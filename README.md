### Observations and Insights
- The final tumor size (mm3) for Capomulin has first quartile and third quartile values that are comparable to those for Ramicane.  The mean tumor volume (mm3) for Capomulin (40.67) is also comparable to the mean tumor volume (mm3) for Ramicane (40.22).  This suggests that these two drug regimens may have similar effects on tumor size over the course of treatment.
- Capomulin and Ramicane also have the most time points compared to other drugs in the study results.  It would be helpful to know what the criteria are for the number of timepoints collected for each mouse (that is, are there more timpoints for these two drug regimens because the mice on these drug regimens lived longer than the mice on other drug regimens?).
- There is a strong correlation (0.84) between average tumor size and mouse weight for mice treated with capomulin.  It is possible that larger mice can live with/sustain with larger tumors.

### Good to Know:
- The plot of the mouse tumor size over time for a mouse treated with Capomulin shows the first mouse in the dataset with a Capomulin treatment regimen.  
- There is only one outlier value for Infubinol.  When printing the outlier, an index value (integer) also prints; this value can be ignored, the actual outlier value is a float.
